"""Time the receive path against the SampleSet route, on real hardware.

Two configurations are compared, one job each:

  OLD  Future built with return_matrix=False, answer read via .sampleset.
       The decoder calls .tolist() on a (reads x qubits) array, wait_sampleset
       walks the lists with a nested comprehension, and dimod converts the
       result back into numpy.
  NEW  Future built with return_matrix=True, answer read via answer_view.
       The decode stays in numpy and no SampleSet is built.

A Future caches its decode, so one job cannot measure both configurations
from cold. Hence two submits. Each timed region starts at an undecoded Future
and ends with the arrays the miner uses. Only the network wait is excluded.

Spends about 86 ms of QPU access time across the two jobs.
