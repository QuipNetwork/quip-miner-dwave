"""The round strategy: is this qblock worth the headroom, or is a faster hour coming?

Runs after the budget said yes, once per qblock boundary, and answers from a
memory snapshot only. The design and its reasoning are in
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-11-qpu-time-of-week-strategy-design.md.

Winning a round depends on the round's difficulty, which the protocol sets
and the miner cannot see ahead, and on how many models the QPU evaluates
while the round is open. Only the second varies with the hour, so the
decision compares slots by deliverable jobs and nothing else.
