"""Read a finished job's answer without building a dimod.SampleSet.

``OceanSampler`` needs five things off an answer: spins, variable labels,
energies, occurrence counts and timing. A ``dwave.cloud.computation.Future``
carries all five already decoded.

Asking for ``.sampleset`` instead costs about 28 ms per job at production
size, and every millisecond of it is spent undoing work. The decoder turns its
numpy arrays into Python lists, ``wait_sampleset`` walks those with a nested
comprehension over reads times variables, and dimod converts the result back
into numpy. Nothing downstream wants a SampleSet; this backend reads the
arrays and writes them to the wire.
