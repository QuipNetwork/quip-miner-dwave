"""Ocean SDK wrapper with v0.2 lessons and offline mock support.

Design points carried from ``QPU/dwave_sampler.py``:
- Thread-pooled async submits (GIL-bound encode/submit off the main path)
- The answer is read off the cloud future once it completes, never decoded
  into a SampleSet on the submit path
- Defect-qubit clamping before submit; reconstruction after decode
- Real ``device_access_time_us`` comes from the timing info already carried
  on the future

Offline mode (``QUIP_DWAVE_MOCK=1`` or an injected sampler) uses a dimod
sampler so unit/conformance tests never hit a real QPU.
