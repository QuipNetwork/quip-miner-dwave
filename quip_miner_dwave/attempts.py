"""Seed and refresh round history from the coordinator's attempts files.

The coordinator appends one JSON line per validated result under
``<data_dir>/<qblock_id>/attempts.jsonl`` (quip-coordinator ``attempt.rs``).
Those lines carry what the miner cannot see on the wire: whether the
coordinator accepted the attempt against the decayed threshold, and whether
it won the qblock. They also reach back before this history existed, so a
first start inherits every past round.

A directory is complete once a higher-numbered one exists. Complete
directories seed once, tracked in ``seeded_dirs``. The two newest are
re-read at every boundary for outcomes only, because a win confirms
shortly after the Cancel it causes.
