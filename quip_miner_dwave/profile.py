"""Day-of-month by hour-of-day estimates from the hourly history.

Two cycles drive D-Wave's shared queue: the working day, and the monthly
contract every account runs on. Each UTC hour keys a cell by (day of the
month normalized to 28 bins, hour of the day), 672 cells in all. A cell on
its own would take months to fill, so the estimate is the multiplicative
main-effects model the call-center literature settles on for intraday-by-
day arrival rates (Weinberg, Brown and Stroud 2007; Ibrahim and L'Ecuyer
2013): the global rate times an hour-of-day factor times a day-of-month
factor, 52 numbers that fill from a few weeks of rows. A cell with its own
evidence then shrinks toward that prediction, so an interaction such as
"month end is slow only in working hours" shows once the cell has seen
enough jobs and is invisible before that.

Every number derives from the operational sums in ``qpu_throughput_hourly``
at query time. Throughput is completions over busy time, mean round trip is
round-trip sum over completions, and the D-Wave queue wait is server
service time minus access time.
