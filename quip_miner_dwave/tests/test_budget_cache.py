"""The participation decision must not touch the disk.

``decide`` runs on the session-loop thread, under the lock that dispatches
jobs, once per job. Reading the ledger there put a SQLite query on the path
that also handles Cancel, Job and Ping, and the ledger lives on a mounted
volume in the deployment.

Spend this process bills is tracked in memory exactly, so the durable record
only has to be consulted when the period rolls over, when the process starts
and inherits a previous run, or on a short interval to pick up a sibling miner
sharing the same usage_db. The ledger stays the source of truth.
