"""Read an answer without building a dimod.SampleSet.

OceanSampler needs five things off a finished job: spins, variable labels,
energies, occurrence counts and timing. A cloud Future carries all five. Going
through .sampleset instead costs 28 ms per job at production size, because it
turns the decoded numpy arrays into Python lists, walks them with a nested
comprehension, and hands them to dimod to turn back into numpy.
