"""How deep the QPU pipeline runs, and who gets to say.

Depth is a property of the device and its cloud round trip, not of the
coordinator's generic flow control, so the backend sets it rather than taking
the SDK's default of 3 — a conservative number chosen for miners in general.

The depth is sized by Little's Law so a QPU that becomes free can be fed at
its own ceiling, not sized to match whatever contention the device shows
today. Measured on Advantage2_system1 with a production-sized problem: 23.2
jobs/s chip ceiling against a 1.57 s round trip needs 36 in flight, and the
3.05 s round trip seen under load needs 71. The default carries slack past
both so a connectivity blip costs throughput rather than stalling the chip.
