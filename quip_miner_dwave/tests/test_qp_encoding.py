"""The submission payload is built from numpy, byte for byte.

Submitting one job costs ~27.5 ms of GIL-bound CPU before anything reaches the
network: ~13 ms building h/J dicts from the wire arrays, then ~14.5 ms inside
the Ocean SDK turning those dicts straight back into two dense float64 arrays.
Both dicts exist only to be walked once in solver-encoding order.

The encoding order is fixed for the life of a session, so the mapping from the
job's edge order into it is a permutation that can be computed once. After
that, encoding a job is two scatters and a base64 of the raw buffer.

Every test here is the same assertion: the bytes match what
``dwave.cloud.coders.encode_problem_as_qp`` produces. That function is the
specification, and pinning against it is what makes bypassing it safe.
