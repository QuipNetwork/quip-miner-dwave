"""QPU budget with even distribution across the quota period.

Replaces the v0.2/v0.3 daily reservoir. That model accumulated credit and then
burnt it in one continuous run, which left the miner dark for a contiguous
multi-hour block once the pool drained — long enough for the rest of the field
to close the gap while the QPU sat idle.

This model paces instead of bursting. The allowance at any instant is the flat
share of the budget that the elapsed part of the period has earned::

    allowance = budget * (now - period_start) / (period_end - period_start)

Mining is allowed while cumulative spend sits under that line. Spend comes from
:mod:`quip_miner_dwave.usage`, so it survives a restart, and the period follows
D-Wave's own quota semantics: a fixed day of the month, UTC, clamped to the
month's length.

Because spend only ever runs a fraction of a qblock past the line before the
gate shuts, and the line keeps rising, the miner idles for one qblock at a time
rather than one night at a time.
