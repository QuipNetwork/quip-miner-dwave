"""PyInstaller spec for the self-contained ``quip-dwave-qa`` executable.

The coordinator spawns miners as subprocesses (`[dwave] binary =
"quip-dwave-qa"` in its config), so this ships the same way the CPU, CUDA and
Metal miners do: one file, no Python interpreter, no venv, no Rust toolchain on
the host.

Build from the repository root:

    pyinstaller --clean --noconfirm pyinstaller/quip-dwave-qa.spec

Everything below was derived by building and then running the result, not from
PyInstaller's static analysis alone, which reports success on a binary that
cannot import Ocean.

# The repository root, one directory above this spec. CI installs the package
# normally, so site-packages carries quip_miner_dwave; a development checkout
# installs it with `pip install -e .`, which hides it behind a .pth import hook
# that PyInstaller's static analysis does not follow. Without this the binary
# built, ran, and died with "No module named 'quip_miner_dwave'".

# `dwave` is a PEP 420 namespace package with no __init__.py, so each
# subpackage has to be named on its own — collecting "dwave" finds nothing.
# The miner itself only touches dimod and dwave.system; the rest sit behind
# lazy imports inside those two, and without them the binary builds and then
# dies with ModuleNotFoundError on first use.
#
# The list is the transitive closure observed by importing dimod and
# dwave.system and then reading sys.modules. Ocean 9 replaced dwave_networkx
# with dwave.graphs and references neither penaltymodel, dwave.samplers nor
# diskcache anywhere under dwave/ or dimod/, so collecting those four only
# inflated the bundle.
